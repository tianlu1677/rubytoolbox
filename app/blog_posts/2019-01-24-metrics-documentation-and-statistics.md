# Metrics Documentation & Statistics

Today I'm happy to introduce a new **[metrics documentation & statistics section][docs]**.

As part of the [ongoing effort](/blog/2019-01-09/new-landing-page) of **making the site more beginner-friendly** all **project metrics now link to a dedicated page that explains the purpose of the metric** and gives guid/Users/jacksontom/Documents/fir-projects/rubytoolbox/app/blog_posts/2019-02-14-project-comparisons.mdance on **how it can help choose a library**.

To make those pages more appealing to all visitors the pages also **feature statistics around the Ruby ecosystem**, including **charts that display the distribution of this metric's values** as well as **top project rankings**. Which [year saw the most new Rubygems](/pages/docs/metrics/rubygem_first_release_on)? Which [gems have the most reverse dependencies](/pages/docs/metrics/rubygem_reverse_dependencies_count)? [How many gems saw their last release in which year](/pages/docs/metrics/rubygem_latest_release_on)? You can now find up-to-date answers to those questions on the Ruby Toolbox:

<a href="/pages/docs/metrics/rubygem_downloads"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13972/51672731-7cda9500-1fcc-11e9-9a3a-6556aa9a7e51.gif"></a>

This addition continues the **[recently started effort](/blog/2019-01-16/bugfix-fork-detection-and-filtering) of bringing more [documentation and guidance to the site][docs]** by making documentation a dedicated site section and bringing a sidebar navigation, enabling the easy addition and discovery of upcoming content.

As usual if you'd like to give feedback or have suggestions for improvements on this a great place for that is the [Pull Request of the feature][pr].

Best,<br/>Christoph
